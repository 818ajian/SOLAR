# SOLAR: Secrnd-Order Loss and Attention for Image Retrieval

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of our ECCV 2020 paper "SOLAR: Second-Order Loss and Attention for Image Retrieval".

Before you go any further, please check out [Filip Radenovic's great repository on image retrieval.](https://github.com/filipradenovic/cnnimageretrieval-pytorch) Our `solar-global` module is heavily built upon it and we highly suggest you to read its great documentation!

## Features
- [x] Complete test scripts for large-scale image retrieval with `solar-global`
- [x] Inference code for extracting local descriptors with `solar-local`
- [x] Second-order attention map visualisation for large images
- [x] Matching performance visualisation
- [ ] Training code for image-retrieval (**coming soon!**)
- [ ] Training code for local descriptors
